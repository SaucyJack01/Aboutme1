     Hello my name is Gavin and I am a highschool graduate curently attending commutity college.I am not the first of my family to attend college but i am the youngest. I am attending commutity college because I would like to aqaire a associate's degree in computer sience. With that I would like to transfer over to virgina tech to be able to get a masters in computer sience. The career I would like to go down is one of a software devolper. there are many benifits to being a software developer, one of them is that it is a very flexible.

      The reason I want to become a software devoloper is because I love video games. At a young age I have loved playing games their my hobby. From there my intrest in how they are made. What is the thought process of a game developer and how they we able to code what came on the screen. To me they are a art form, a way to put your soul out there in code for the world to see.
